If you’re a student or a professional looking to get ahead, you need a website. It’s your chance to establish an online home base, impress recruiters, and provide something that will set you apart from the stacks of static resumes that everyone else is submitting for job applications.

But creating your own website can be overwhelming. Even if you’ve got the basic technical details down, the possibilities for design, layout, and text are nearly endless.

Because of this, it can be helpful to see some examples of what other people are doing. That way, when you create (or even update) your website, you’ll have some ideas of what to do to ensure that your website doesn’t look (or sound) like it’s from 1995.

That’s why we created this resource. It’s a compilation of 50 of our favorite personal website examples from around the internet. In addition to showcasing the site, each example also includes an explanation of what the example can teach you about creating your own website.

We hope this list gives you the inspiration you need to make your own website. And when you’re ready, you can follow our complete, step-by-step website building tutorial, which will help you get it done quickly and easily.

Let’s get started!
